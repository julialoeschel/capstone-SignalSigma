# Files and directories to ignore in the 
# public version of the repository.

# To filter the repository, install git-filter-repo:
# ``` shell
# brew install git-filter-repo
# ```
# Then, run the following commands:
# ``` shell
# git filter-repo --invert-paths --paths-from-file .pubignore 
# ```
# As this command is destructive, it is recommended to create 
# a backup of the repository before running it!
